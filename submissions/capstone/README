The Amazon review data used for this project can be found at http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/

The project requires Dask, Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels, and Tensorflow to complete. The analysis was run using CUDA, while this is not
required, it will significantly improve performance. All analyses were performed in a conda environment generated with the command

conda create -n capstone python=3.6 ipykernel numpy scipy pandas matplotlib statsmodels tensorflow scikit-learn

Dask must be installed with pip, using the command

pip install dask[complete]
